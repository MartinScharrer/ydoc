The 'ydoc' class and packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'ydoc' provides macros and environments to document LaTeX packages and classes.
It is an alternative to the 'ltxdoc' class and 'doc' package.
It targets a different layout and tries to provide more modern styles (xcolor, hyperref, etc.).

This is an alpha release. It should not be used yet for other packages.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~

This package might be part of your LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MikTeX, ...) and then is installable using
the distributions package manager (TeX Live: 'tlmgr install ydoc').
However, it is also manually installable using the following ways:

1) TDS ZIP FILE
A TDS ZIP file includes all files in a installable format and using the required directory structure.
Simply unzip the TDS ZIP file over your TEXMF tree.

The TDS ZIP file can be downloaded from CTAN:
http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/ydoc.tds.zip


2) DTX FILE
The 'ydoc.dtx' file includes all required files, which can be extracted by compiling it using TeX (not LaTeX):

    tex ydoc.dtx

To build the documentation compile the same file using LaTeX (preferable 'pdflatex') multiple times:

    pdflatex ydoc.dtx
    pdflatex ydoc.dtx
    pdflatex ydoc.dtx

Copy all files to their correct location of your local TEXMF tree.
For example under Linux a personal TEXMF is normally located at '~/texmf' ('$HOME/texmf').
The files can be installed using the following Linux commands. For 

    mkdir -p  ${TEXMF}/tex/latex/ydoc/
    cp   ydoc.cls  ydoc*.sty  ydoc.cfg  ydocstrip.tex   ${TEXMF}/tex/latex/ydoc/

Update the tree database file (might be not required for modern versions and personal TEXMF trees):

    texhash ${TEXMF}
